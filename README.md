# Poseidon -- A buildin V2ray plugin

## Why change the name of the repo

The name have to be changed for these reasons:

1. I've learnt that there are still many panels need to be adapt with V2ray
  - SSPanel-v3
  - WEBAPI SSRPanel（VNetPanel）
2. I'd like to provide a new deployment way
  - Poseidon-Master node
    - Automatic install Poseidon-V2ray node on new nodes which you added to the server list in your panel
    - Automatic config Poseidon-V2ray node
    - Real-time script output of deployment can be seen in Web browsers
    - Any time and any where you can execute shell commands in your poseidon-v2ray node
  - Poseidon-V2ray node
3. To config with ease, a bran-new [v2ray config generator](https://github.com/ColetteContreras/poseidon-v2ray-config-generator) is going to be introduced to Poseidon-master.

### What's the difference between `Community` version and `Enterprise` version?

Community version can only be used for a small user scale, which user count is less than 50.

Enterprise version has no limit. [How to get Enterprise version? and how much is it?](https://github.com/ColetteContreras/v2ray-poseidon/wiki/How-to-get-Enterprise-version%3F-and-how-much-is-it%3F)

## Updates

- v1.0.0

  Breaking Changes:

  - config files structure has been changed, new structure is:

  ```diff
  {
  -  "ssrpanel": {
  +  "poseidon": {
      ... ... 
    }
  }
  ```
  
  - Added IP limit
    - It's a number that how many ip a user can use at the same moment
    - You can set user's `protocol_param` field on the database
  - Added rate limit
    - You should set user's `speed_limit_per_user` and `speed_limit_per_conn` fields on the database
  - Added closing user connections instantly after user has been deleted
    - By default the user's connections will not be disconnected after being deleted, but that is not we wanted.

=========================

Only one thing user should do is that setting up the database connection, without doing that user needn't do anything!

### Features

- Sync user from SSRPanel database to v2ray
- Log user traffic

### Benefits

- No other requirements
  - It's  able to run if you could launch v2ray core
- Less memory usage
  - It just takes about 5MB to 10MB memories more than v2ray core
  - Small RAM VPS would be joyful
- Simplicity configuration
